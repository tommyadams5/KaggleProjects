Transformer language models are a type of neural network that are used for natural language processing tasks such as machine translation, text summarization, and question answering. They are known for their ability to learn long-range dependencies between words, which makes them well-suited for tasks that require understanding the context of a sentence or paragraph. \n","\n","In this project, I will build a transformer language model in PyTorch to generate lyrics in the style of Taylor Swift. I will do this by training the model on a dataset of lyrics from Taylor Swift's songs. The model will learn the patterns of Taylor Swift's writing style, and it will be able to use this knowledge to generate new lyrics that are similar to hers.\n","\n","The project will be divided into the following steps:\n","\n","- Collect a dataset of lyrics from Taylor Swift's songs.\n","- Prepare the dataset for training.\n","- Build the transformer language model.\n","- Train the model.\n","- Evaluate the model's performance.\n","- Generate new lyrics using the model.\n","\n","## Model Architecture\n","\n","My model architecture will be based on the paper \"Attention Is All You Need\", which can be seen in the image above. However, there will be some differences between my model and the model in the paper:\n","\n","- My transformers will not have an encoder or cross-attention portions since I am not translating from one language to another like in the paper. As a result, my transformers will only perform masked self-attention.\n","- I chose to do the normalization phase before the multi-head attention and feed forward portions of the model, as opposed to doing it afterwards like in the paper. I wanted to reduce gradients created by the attention and feed forward layers in the hopes that it would make training more stable. \n","- The paper chose to use cosine and sine positional embeddings to teach the model to generalize for longer context lengths than it was trained on. I chose to use a simple ascending numbering of the positions since my model is much smaller and I do not expect comprehension of long context lengths to be a limiting factor.\n","- Because I am limited by the computational power of my cpu, I chose to create a model with less layers, smaller embedding groups, and smaller training batch sizes. Also, I chose to have the model predict the next character as opposed to predicting the next word, which reduced the vocabulary of the model  and its computational intensity.

Results\n","\n","Although the final output of the model sounds like gibberish, it greatly improved from its initial state where it vomited random characters. The model is able to produce real words, which is impressive given that it is only trained to predict the next character. The model has also learned to capitalize the first word of each line, and produces lines of lyrics that are on average the same length as the lyrics in the data set. I elected to stop training at this point because the model test error is only making small improvements with each iteration. \n","\n","This model shows the limitations of creating language models with a relatively small amount of compute power. Clearly, there is a lot of room for the model to improve. Using GPUs and distributed training would boost computational power and enable the model to become more complex with additional transformers, more embedding groups, and longer context sizes. Towards the end of the training, the model also started to suffer from overfitting, since the testing error was consistently higher than the training set error. To help reduce overfitting, I could introduce a dropping layer that would randomly drop some weights from the model; however, this would also significantly increase the training time to convergence. \n"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"id":"489d89b0","metadata":{"papermill":{"duration":0.0148,"end_time":"2023-09-01T19:15:20.76967","exception":false,"start_time":"2023-09-01T19:15:20.75487","status":"completed"},"tags":[]},"outputs":[],"source":[]}],"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"file_extension":".py","mimetype":"text/x-python","name":"python","nbconvert_exporter":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","version":"3.6.4"},"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"file_extension":".py","mimetype":"text/x-python","name":"python","nbconvert_exporter":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","version":"3.10.12"},"papermill":{"default_parameters":{},"duration":529.664969,"end_time":"2023-09-01T19:15:22.215035","environment_variables":{},"exception":null,"input_path":"__notebook__.ipynb","output_path":"__notebook__.ipynb","parameters":{},"start_time":"2023-09-01T19:06:32.550066","version":"2.4.0"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":5}
