# Personal Bio

After nine years in real estate development, I am looking to begin a career in machine learning. I have a strong foundation in financial analysis and statistics, and have recent hands-on experience in both machine learning and data science. I am a quick, self-directed learner, and my track record of personal projects includes building transformer language models and generative adversarial networks.
